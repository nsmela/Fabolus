# Fabolus
Fabolus used to modify 3D boli for radiation therapy. This application can import a STL file, smooth it (using poisson reconstruction or marching cubes), 
add airchannels, and create an encompasing mold around the bolus and subtracting the air channels. The result can be 3D printed and used as a mold for curing silicon.
